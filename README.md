# ORO-sorting
ORO is a python app that sorts a list of numbers in several ways.
ORO is a practice of some of what i learned in Python, i know that there is existing libreries that sorts numbers and more, but why not i make my own! or maybe develope it to be better!

Hello My friend! I'm ORO🦉 The Sorting Bot... Nice to meet you!
I'm here to help you ordering as many numbers as you want in Ascending or Descending way! with some other adds.
> How to use:
- the app is asking you to enter a number, so enter it then hit "Enter" and so on...
- if you are finished enter the word "end" in any type you want (END/End...) even we accept einde if you are speaking "Dutch" 🍺🇩🇪
- Then you'll understand every thing that i'll ask you
Enjoy! and don't forget to send us your oppinion.
